# cityPop
CityPop is an app built on React Native for looking up the population of cities around the world through the geonames API. 

# Setting up the app environment
1. clone this repo by running the following commands in your terminal: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/wkagebo/cityPop-app.git
    
    cd cityPop-app/src
    ```
2. Make sure that you have installed npm on your computer before running the following commands in the same directory (src):
    ```bash
    npm install
    
    npm start 
    ```
3. Follow the instructions given in the browser page that automatically opens after running ```npm start```. 
4. Either run the app directly in the browser or download "Expo Go" on either iOS or Android, in which you will be able to run the app on your phone after scanning the QR code in the browser window. 
5. Feel free to tweak the app to your liking by modifying the code in a text editor of your choice. Expo will auto update whenever you save your coding progress.
